//Notes
/* Multer handles incoming file(from client) uploads by temporarily saving them in a local folder (./public/temp) so that the backend can access the actual file. After that, the  file isuploaded to Cloudinary using its SDK. Cloudinary stores the file in the cloud and returns a response containing details like the file URL, public_id,and format. We usually save this URL in the database and delete the local file  since itâ€™s no longer needed.*/
